# Todo

CLI tool for manipulating source code TODOs

## Usage ##

```
Usage: todo [<id> --] [register --] <files...>
```

### Examples

```console
$ todo src/main.ml                # show all TODOs in the src/main.ml file
$ todo $(git ls-repo)             # show all TODOs in the current git repo
$ todo 23 -- $(git ls-repo)       # find TODO(23) in the current git repo
$ todo register -- $(git ls-repo) # for every ID-less TODO in git repo assign a random V4 UUID
```

## Build and Dev ##

```console
$ opam install oasis ounit uuidm batteries
$ ./configure --enable-tests
$ make
$ make test
$ make install
```

### NixOS Development Environment ###

We have `default.nix` for NixOS user, but **please, read default.nix
file before nix-shell-ing it!** It is not pure and it manipulates
`.opam/` in the home directory of the current user.

If you have better ideas on organizing the dev environment, feel free
to file an issue or a PR.

### NixOS overlay ###

To install the overlay just symlink the `overlay` folder to the
corresponding place:

```console
$ ln -s ./overlay ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays/todo-overlay
$ nix-env -iA nixos.todo
```
